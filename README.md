# Personal Finance PowerBI Dashboard
A project that utilizes Microsoft PowerBI to analyze personal financial data and visualize expenses through an interactive dashboard.


## Problem Description

As one should, I have been keeping track of all my daily spending using Microsoft Excel. Using basic sorting/filtering in Excel I'm able to see a very high-level overview of my spending. In order to perform data analysis at a more deeper level, we will turn my static Excel data into dynamic PowerBI dashboards.


## Project Goals

Here are the questions I would like the PowerBI dashboards to answer:
- Monthly spending (in a given year).
- How much money spent per item category.
- List all expenses with comments.
- How much money spent per location.
- The number of purchases in various price ranges.
- Quarterly and weekly spending information.
- Various average costs (per week, month, day).
- Comparison of food costs to restaurant costs.
- Spending behavior when I'm sick.
- Comparison of weekday and weekend spending.
